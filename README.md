The main aim of this project is to develop and evaluate various sentiment analysis approaches. Additionally, the creation and application of a custom model using machine-learning will be researched. This model will be customised to a particular application and evaluated to see the benefit of this type of approach. Finally, a visualisation of the sentiment gathered using these models will be provided to users in a sleek, easy-to-use webpage.
